# id-Tech3 Mapping Website

## Local development
1. Install Node. [(recommended: `nvm`)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  
2. Install all required npm modules with `npm install` from `src/docusaurus` when running it for the first time.
3. Run `npm start` from the `src/docusaurus` folder.  
   The command will launch a development version of the website that can be accessed from `localhost`.

### [`./content`](./content)
Stores all of the files that will be interpreted as content for the website.  
### [`./src/website.config.ts`](./src/website.config.ts)
Stores all of the site's configuration options in one place for easier/simpler access.  
### [`./src/docusaurus`](./src/docusaurus)
Holds the files required by the framework to work.  
No need to modify anything, so the technical stuff is stored away into this folder.  
Run `npm start` from this folder to launch a development version of the website from `localhost`.
### [`./src/pages`](./src/pages)
Root folder of the pages plugin.  
Every `js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,mdx` file that doesn't start with `_` will be interpreted as a standalone website page.
### [`./src/css`](./src/css)
Folder where global css files should be stored.  
_note: Not mandatory. Pages could also store their css right next to them as `PAGE.module.css`_
### [`./src/blog`](./src/blog)
_(disabled)_
Holds the content that will show up in the blog section.  
### [`./public`](./public)
Folder where build files are stored locally when creating a release build.  
Ignored by git. Only for development/testing. The website is deployed into a separate branch.
