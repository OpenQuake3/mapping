Quality of models in this pack is *very* mixed and not great overall by todays standards.
Models don't need to be anywhere near that low-poly nowadays. Try to find better models if you can.

**Make sure to place the 'br_....' folders into 'baseq3/models/mapobjects/' for them to be displayed properly in radiant and ingame.**
