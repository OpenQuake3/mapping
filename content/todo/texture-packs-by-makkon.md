Incredible texture packs by **Makkon**

These are all 512px textures made for Quake 1. That game has nearest pixel filtering (pixelated look) whereas Quake 3 has linear pixel filtering (pixels blur into each other) by default which might make some textures here look worse or even cause problems with the [nearest pixel issue](https://trello.com/c/yLaMVbp0).
In this case it can be a good idea to upscale to 1024px without resampling (in photoshop this setting would be 'Nearest Neighbor (hard edges)) before implementing into your q3 map.
