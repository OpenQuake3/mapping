# Actively developed NetRadiant

`in active development`

Incredible enhancement of the original NetRadiant and q3map2, actively developed by **Garux**.
Mainly catered towards Quake 3 / defrag but should be great for other id Tech 3 games. Some other communities might have their own branches.

**Features:**
- FBX model support (and many other formats)
- UV mapper
- Improved map-to-.obj export plugin (keeps brushes intact without edgesplit)
- Custom Keybinds
- WASD camera
- Autocaulk
- Customizable GUI
- Customizable build/compile menu
- and many more... (see [**Feature Showcase**](https://garux.github.io/NRC/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Garux/netradiant-custom#netradiant-custom))
