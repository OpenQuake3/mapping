# Interpolate animMap frames


---

###Two shader stages work together to interpolate (smoothly fade between) animMap frames:

 - The first stage starts with frame #1 and fades it from visible to invisible using a sawtooth wave.
 - At the same time, the second stage fades frame #2 from invisible to visible using an inversed sawtooth wave.

âžœâ €This results in a smooth transition between frames #1 and #2.

ðŸ›ˆ *This technique was already used in the original q3a shaders by id.*

While each animMap shader stage is limited to a maximum of 8 frames, multiple shader stages can be combined to extend the animation. This technique is described [here](https://trello.com/c/hVxaKLjW/246-background-video-in-idfe-menu-q3-defrag)
