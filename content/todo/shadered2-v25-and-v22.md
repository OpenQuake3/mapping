# ShaderEd2 (v2.5 and v2.2)

A great alternative to q3ase with more functionality. The blend picker is especially useful.

does anyone know how to set the .ini to a quake3 one - or is it necessary?


### qu8it on 2021-10-15

@raytrace1 you can open any shader file with 'file > open'
i dont know if there is a q3 ini or if one could be created or what that would even do. please let us know if you find out though.

thanks @qu8it - yeah I do think it is unecessary - it just seems to ask you at first setup - double clicking shaders opens them in ShaderEd for me now so I'm happy anyway :)
