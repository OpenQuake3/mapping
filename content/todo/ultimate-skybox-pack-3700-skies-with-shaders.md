# Ultimate Skybox Pack (3700+ Skies with Shaders)

---

**Ghost** and **Garux** (FM/AM) have been working on this project for about 8 months.

They collected all the Skyboxes they could find and updated their shaders to make use of new/improved q3map2 features so make sure to use the [latest release of q3map2](https://github.com/Garux/netradiant-custom/releases) which is bundled with NetRadiant Custom. Version 20220211 or newer is required.

This pack includes skyboxes from all sorts of id Tech 3 and surce engine maps as well as newly created/adapted ones. The process included painstakingly loading up every single skybox in the game, getting the sun position and sky colors to add them to the shaders. Even going as far as fixing seams in many of the textures as well as creating a panoramic editorimage for each skybox so you can easily browse them in radiant's texture browser.

In light of this, Garux has also been working on a new NetRadiant feature where you can see the skybox inside the editor. This feature is currently available in the [development build](https://github.com/Garux/netradiant-custom/releases) and will be available in the next release after version 20220211 which is the latest version as of this post.

Truly a monumental piece of work done by these two! Enjoy!

##Disclaimer:

By the nature of this project, it would have been very hard, and partly impossible, to track down the original release of every single skybox. As a result of this, it's likely that some of these skyboxes are copyrighted or released with a license that requires author credit when using the skybox. Of course, none of these skyboxes should be used commercially unless you track down the original source and make sure that you have permission.

New root folder created 'skpk' to avoid conflicting textures.
Shaders broken into sub-directories: skies_MASTER, _MASTER2, _MASTER3, _MASTER4, _MASTER5 & _MASTER6 to avoid lengthy load times in radiant.
Shaders grouped as best as possible. IE: most dynamic skies can be found in _MASTER6
