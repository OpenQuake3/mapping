# Welcome!
This Trello Board is dedicated to collect any information relevant to creating levels, shaders and other content for games running in any id Tech 3 based engine.

The goal is to bring all these small communities closer together to learn from each other and collaborate on developing new tools and techniques that can be useful to us all.

If you have anything to add and want to contribute, please contact me through Discord: qubit.q3
